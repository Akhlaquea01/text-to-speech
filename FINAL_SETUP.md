## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "FFmpeg not found"
Install FFmpeg and make sure it's in your system PATH. Restart terminal after installation.

### "Module not found"
```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### Audio not generating
Check console output for errors. Make sure FFmpeg is properly installed.

### Server won't start
Check if port 8000 is in use:
```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :8000
```

## 💡 Optional: AI Features

For automatic emotion detection, install Ollama:

1. Download from: https://ollama.ai
2. Install llama3 model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3
   ```
3. Enable "Use AI to auto-detect emotions" in the web interface

## ✨ Future Improvements (Optional)

If you need higher quality later:

1. **Downgrade to Python 3.11** and use Coqui TTS
2. **Use ElevenLabs API** (commercial, high quality)
3. **Use pyttsx3** for offline voices (lower quality)

But for now, **gTTS works perfectly for your needs!** ✅

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that FFmpeg is installed
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Check console output for error messages
4. Ensure port 8000 is available
